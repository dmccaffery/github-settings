# org-config.sh — export/import a GitHub organisation's rulesets and general
# settings, plus fan repo labels out across the org; the org-level companion to
# repo-config.sh.
#
#   ./org-config.sh export <org> [dir]        # dump config  -> dir (default: ./org-config)
#   ./org-config.sh import <org> [dir]        # apply config <- dir
#   ./org-config.sh labels-sync [--public|--private] <org> [dir]
#   ./org-config.sh sync        [--public|--private] <org> [dir]
#   ./org-config.sh teams-sync  [--public|--private] <org>
#
# org defaults to bitwise-media-group. The *-sync commands fan config out across
# the org's repos and take --public / --private to limit which repos by
# visibility. labels-sync and sync read a snapshot dir (default: ./repo-config):
#   labels-sync  applies only <dir>/labels.json to each repo.
#   sync         runs the full repo-config.sh import (settings, rulesets, labels).
#   teams-sync   grants a team (default: bitwise-maintainers) a permission
#                (default: maintain) on every repo; takes no dir.
#
# What's covered:
#   - Organisation-level rulesets only (full definitions: conditions, rules,
#     bypass_actors); rulesets inherited from an enterprise are ignored in both
#     directions. Org rulesets share the repo-ruleset shape but their conditions
#     also target which repositories they apply to (repository_name /
#     repository_property), captured as part of conditions.
#   - General org settings, grouped as:
#       member-privileges  default_repository_permission,
#                          members_can_create_repositories and the
#                          public/private/internal/pages variants,
#                          members_can_fork_private_repositories
#       new-repo defaults  dependabot / dependency-graph / secret-scanning
#                          toggles applied to repositories created in the org
#       commits            web_commit_signoff_required
#
# Deliberately excluded: identity (name, description, billing_email, company,
# email, location, blog), plan/seat data, and anything server-managed.
#
# Mirror semantics: both directions sync rather than merge.
#   - export wipes <dir>/rulesets first, so it reflects exactly what's live.
#   - import makes the org's rulesets match <dir>/rulesets: update/create the
#     ones with a file, delete any ruleset that has no matching file. A missing
#     rulesets dir is left untouched; an empty one means "remove them all".
#
# Labels: GitHub has no org-level labels API — org "default labels" are a UI-only
# setting that merely seeds NEW repos. So labels-sync instead fans a canonical
# repo-config/labels.json out to EVERY non-archived repo in the org, applying the
# same upsert + delete mirror logic repo-config.sh uses (this also covers repos
# that already exist). Destructive by design: a label absent from the file is
# deleted from each repo, which removes it from that repo's issues/PRs. Set
# KEEP_EXTRA=1 to only add/update and never delete.
#
# Teams: teams-sync grants one org team a single permission on EVERY non-archived
# repo in the org, so a standing maintainer team gets access to repos created
# after it was set up. Defaults to the bitwise-maintainers team at maintain (the
# "as maintainers" access level); override with TEAM / TEAM_PERMISSION. Purely
# additive and idempotent: GitHub's team-repo PUT upserts the grant, and the
# command never removes a team from a repo (no mirror/delete pass).
#
# Env:
#   STRIP_BYPASS=1   drop ruleset bypass_actors on export — use when the bypass
#                    actors (teams, apps, custom roles) won't exist in the target.
#   KEEP_EXTRA=1     labels-sync only: add/update labels but never delete ones a
#                    repo has that aren't in labels.json (additive, not mirror).
#   TEAM=<slug>      teams-sync only: org team to grant (default bitwise-maintainers).
#   TEAM_PERMISSION  teams-sync only: pull|triage|push|maintain|admin or a custom
#                    role name (default maintain).
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated, org owner), jq.
# Note: reading/writing org settings and rulesets requires organisation owner;
#       switch accounts with `gh auth switch` if the active one lacks access.
